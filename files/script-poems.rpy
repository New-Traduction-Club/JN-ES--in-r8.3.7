    old "Another cake, another candle\nAnother year that you've just handled\nSome people dread this special day\nAnd push the thought so far away\nBut I don't think it's bad!\n\nAnother gift, another guest\nAnother year you've tried your best\nSome people cherish this special day\nTalk, dance, party and play\nHow could you think that's sad?\n\nNo more doubts, no more fears\nIgnore the numbers, forget the years\nThis poem is your birthday cheers\n\nNow grab yourself a plate!\n"

    old "It's\nChilly and\nCold outside\nBut warm inside\nWith you by my side.\nListening to the cozy fire\nSitting side by side together.\nTalking to one another, making\nNew memories that shine brightly.\nIlluminating even the darkest of nights\nTo allow weary travelers a guiding light\nA star guided path ahead in a stressful life.\nPrevious troubles melt away in the hot cocoa\nThat I hold tight as I tease you to find your own.\nWas always my favorite, but now, so more than ever\nAs it tastes more sweet with new and fresh ingredients.\nThe warmth I feel inside will outlast any amount of winter\nBecause with you by my side\nI'm always ready for another.\n"

    old "From a brittle gingerbread household Amy came\nDisguised by colorful icing and confectionaries\nOne that hid the shouts and all the arguments\nOne that hid in plain sight, opposed to spotlight\n\nBut where we come from doesn't define\nWho we truly are deep on the inside\nAnd sometimes all it takes is someone.\nSomeone new to remind you of more.\n\nA new friend to help decorate a tree.\nAn evergreen free for decoration\nEagerly awaiting two people\nTo coat it with ornaments and lights.\n\nThat tree a template of what's to come\nA place where new memories can form\nWhere gingerbread can appear brittle\nWithout needing to lie, with honesty.\n\nBeing welcomed without all the bells and whistles\nAs acceptance provides warmth in the coldest of winters\n"

    old "Vibrant trees spring back anew\nAs fluorescent hues illuminate\nThe path for crowds to gather\nCame to recognize life's splendor\n\nBefore long the petals branch out\nAs they gently fly in the breeze\nUntil they reach the hand of another\nAnd gently touch the lives of others\n\nSome may think that their job is done\nAnd while that may indeed be true\nTheir beauty continues to live on\nThrough the people who were touched\n\nThey take up the mantle to create anew\nThey sow the seeds and supply the water\nTo help usher in other forms of beauty\nAs a rainbow of flora emerge to shine\n"

    old "Climbing on top of a mountain doesn't make a hiker tall\nBut accomplishment of reaching that height says it all\nClimbing up a ladder though is another thing altogether\nBut try as one reaches, clouds stay high dispersing weather\n\nPeople who once dreamed of flight were looked upon with gall\nTold that they should know their place and keep to being small\nThe two brothers looked upon birds flapping feather after feather\nUntil one day what was thought impossible was born together\n\nThose are both extraordinary feats, but both are measured differently\nBe it stick, ruler, measuring tape, but how do we measure ability?\nGrowth comes in many forms and that's rather tough to truly gauge\nSo as calendars wizz on by, what is changed besides someone's age?\n\nKids are always told to expect a growth spurt, and they accept willingly\nBut nobody ever talks about how growth can hurt often without sympathy\nPeople are simply much more than just in what they choose to engage\nBut others like to make assumptions and usher in unnecessary rage\n\nPeople are so much more than what their appearance may present\nStature can only say so much as opposed to what lies beneath pleasant\n"

    old "When the month ends, the costumes come out\nChildren dress up and run door to door with glee\nOr be it the haunted houses ready to cause a shout\nThis holiday holds something for everyone to see\n\nIn her case, not so much as she will commonly pout\nAs common festivities aren't always simple and carefree\nSo when she sees everyone at play she can only doubt\nAnd wish that things could be different, that is her plea\n\nThrough the lamenting, she's ready to let down her guard\nShe's ready to laugh, yell, jump in horror and scream.\nAll things that previously once left her afraid and scarred.\nBut experiencing all of that in a much safer space? A dream.\n\nSo take her on that journey, be her accompanying bodyguard\nAnd let her experience what she always desired her eyes agleam\nShe'll let you in and together she'll be free with sadness to discard\nHer face shining through the darkness, the holiday now redeemed\n\nSo applying some effort and being patient with her is no trick.\nBecause a smile from her is worth more than any received treat!\n"
